# MCP GitHub Issue Matcher

A FastAPI-based service that matches developers with relevant GitHub issues based on their programming skills and experience level. The application analyzes GitHub user profiles to extract skills from repositories and activity, then recommends appropriate open source issues for contribution.

## üöÄ Features

- **Skill-Based Matching**: Find issues based on programming languages and technologies you specify
- **GitHub Profile Analysis**: Automatically extract skills from your GitHub repositories and activity
- **Experience Level Matching**: Get issues appropriate for your skill level (beginner to expert)
- **Multiple Issue Types**: Support for "good first issue", "help wanted", "bug", "enhancement", and more
- **Relevance Scoring**: Issues are ranked by relevance to your skills and preferences
- **RESTful API**: Clean API endpoints with comprehensive documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modular design with separated concerns:

- **FastAPI Server** (`mcp_server.py`): Main API server with MCP endpoint implementations
- **GitHub Analyzer** (`github_analyzer.py`): Extracts user skills from GitHub profiles
- **Issue Matcher** (`issue_matcher.py`): Finds and scores relevant issues based on skills
- **Skill Extractor** (`skill_extractor.py`): Categorizes programming languages and technologies
- **Data Models** (`models.py`): Pydantic models for type-safe data validation
- **Configuration** (`config.py`): Centralized configuration management

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- GitHub personal access token (optional but recommended for higher rate limits)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mcp-github-issue-matcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic aiohttp PyGithub python-multipart
```

3. (Optional) Set up environment variables:
```bash

## üìù Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Issues by Skills

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/match-issues-by-skills" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "skills": ["python", "django", "rest-api"],
    "experience_level": "intermediate",
    "issue_types": ["good first issue", "help wanted"],

  }'
```

### Example 2: Analyze GitHub Profile and Find Issues

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/match-issues-by-username" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "octocat",
    "issue_types": ["good first issue"],
    "max_results": 5
  }'
```

### Example 3: Just Analyze Skills

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/analyze-user/octocat"
```

## üìä Response Format

All endpoints return JSON responses with this structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 123456,
      "number": 42,
      "title": "Add authentication feature",
      "body": "We need to implement user authentication...",
      "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42",
      "repository_name": "owner/repo",
      "repository_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
      "labels": ["good first issue", "python", "authentication"],
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-02T12:00:00Z",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "matched_skills": ["python", "authentication"],
      "relevance_score": 8.5
    }
  ],
  "total_found": 15,
  "user_skills": {
    "languages": ["python", "javascript"],
    "technologies": ["django", "react", "postgresql"],
    "experience_level": "intermediate",
    "github_stats": {
      "public_repos": 25,
      "followers": 15,
      "following": 30,
      "account_age_years": 2.5
    }
  },
  "message": "Found 15 matching issues for @username"
}
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **Skill Extraction**: The system analyzes GitHub repositories to extract:
   - Programming languages from repository languages
   - Technologies from repository names, descriptions, and topics
   - Experience level from account age, repository count, and activity

2. **Issue Matching**: Issues are found by:
   - Searching GitHub for issues with relevant labels
   - Filtering by programming languages and technologies
   - Checking popular repositories for each skill

3. **Relevance Scoring**: Issues are scored based on:
   - Skill matching (languages and technologies)
   - Difficulty level alignment
   - Issue recency and activity
   - Repository popularity and quality

## üö® Rate Limits

- **Without GitHub Token**: 60 requests per hour
- **With GitHub Token**: 5000 requests per hour

To avoid rate limiting, provide a GitHub personal access token via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
